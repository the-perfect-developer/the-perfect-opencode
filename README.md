A curated collection of agents, skills, and commands for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — with a streamlined process to install, update, and extend your AI-powered development environment.

**[Complete Tools Reference](docs/tools-reference.md)**

---

## Installation

Install the core collection with a single command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-perfect-developer/opencode-base-collection/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

This installs specialized agents, domain-specific skills, and workflow commands into your project's `.opencode/` directory.

> For LLMs assisting with setup, see [Installation Guide](docs/installation-guide.md).

---

## Tool Management

After the initial install, use these commands to manage your tools from within OpenCode:

**`/install-perfect-tools`** — Guides you through discovering and installing agents, skills, and commands tailored to your project's stack and workflow.

**`/update-perfect-tools`** — Compares your installed tools against the latest catalog and updates any that have changed.

**`/recommend-perfect-tool`** — Silently analyzes your project (languages, frameworks, CI config) and recommends tools you haven't installed yet — no questions asked.

---

## Development Workflow

### Lightweight Tasks

For everyday features and tasks, use the quick workflow:

```
/plan    build a user authentication flow
/implement
```

`/plan` gathers requirements and produces an implementation plan. `/implement` executes it using the appropriate specialized agents.

### Complex Features

For larger features that require architectural input, security review, or performance analysis, use the extended workflow:

```
/extended-plan    build a real-time notification system
/extended-implement
```

`/extended-plan` runs a six-phase planning process: requirement gathering, codebase analysis, research, multi-agent consultation (@architect, @security-expert, @performance-engineer), plan generation, and user review.

`/extended-implement` runs a seven-phase orchestrated implementation: requirements analysis, task breakdown, parallel agent execution, quality assurance, testing, and final documentation. Agents are selected by task type — @frontend-engineer for UI, @backend-engineer for APIs, @junior-engineer for simple fixes — and independent tasks run in parallel.

---

## Customization Commands

Extend OpenCode with your own resources:

**`/create-rule`** — Adds a `MUST FOLLOW` rule to your project's `AGENTS.md`, keeping coding standards and conventions enforced across all agents.

**`/create-agent`** — Interactive agent builder. Configures model, temperature, tool permissions, and system prompt, then writes the agent file to `.opencode/agents/`.

**`/create-skill`** — Scaffolds a new skill with proper frontmatter, progressive disclosure structure, and validation guidance.

**`/create-command`** — Walks through requirements and generates a slash command in `.opencode/commands/` with the correct frontmatter, argument handling, and agent routing.
