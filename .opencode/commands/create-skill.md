- Provide working examples in examples/
- Test with real use cases
- Use consistent terminology throughout

**DON'T**:
- Use vague descriptions without trigger phrases
- Put everything in SKILL.md without using references/
- Write in second person ("you should") or first person ("I can help")
- Skip validation before using
- Create deeply nested references (keep one level)
