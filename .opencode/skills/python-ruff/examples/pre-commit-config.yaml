# Install: pre-commit install

    # Pin to a specific version — check https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit/releases
    rev: v0.9.0
    hooks:
      # Linter: check and auto-fix safe violations
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
        # Include Jupyter notebooks
        types_or: [python, pyi, jupyter]

      # Formatter: format Python files
      - id: ruff-format
        types_or: [python, pyi, jupyter]

# To include Markdown files in formatting (preview feature):
#   - id: ruff-format
#     types_or: [python, pyi, jupyter, markdown]
#     args: [--preview]

# Hook execution order matters:
# ruff (linter with --fix) must run BEFORE ruff-format
# so the formatter sees already-fixed imports and syntax.
