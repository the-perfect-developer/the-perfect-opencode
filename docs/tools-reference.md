## Agents

Agents are specialized AI assistants designed for specific tasks in The Perfect OpenCode. Each agent has a unique personality, expertise, and set of tools tailored to their domain. You can invoke agents using the `@agent-name` syntax or switch between them using keyboard shortcuts.

The Perfect OpenCode provides several built-in agents that cover different aspects of software development. Each agent is configured with specific permissions and capabilities to excel in their domain while maintaining security and consistency.

## Skills

Skills are reusable sets of instructions and workflows that provide domain-specific guidance. They can be loaded by agents to access specialized knowledge, templates, and best practices for particular technologies or frameworks. Skills follow a progressive disclosure pattern, providing essential information first with detailed references available on demand.

The Perfect OpenCode comes with a comprehensive collection of skills covering programming languages, frameworks, tools, and development workflows. Each skill provides targeted guidance and can include reference materials, examples, and helper scripts.

## Commands

Commands are custom slash commands that provide quick access to common workflows and operations. They can be invoked using the `/command-name` syntax in the chat interface. Each command can specify which agent and model should be used to execute it, ensuring optimal performance for the task at hand.

The Perfect OpenCode includes several built-in commands that streamline common development tasks. Commands can combine multiple operations, provide interactive workflows, and leverage specialized agents for complex tasks.
